# DOLLAR LABELING
# Write a function that takes a number and returns a string formatted as a dollar amount
# e.g. dollar(123) --> "$123"; dollar(1234) --> "$1,234"
# Something you might want to decide is whether to round to the nearest dollar,
# or include cents, or include an argument that lets the user decide.
# e.g. should dollar(123.45) --> "$123", or "$123.45"? That's up to you.
# How do you want to handle negative values? e.g. "-$123" vs "$-123"?
# Look at the `format`, `paste`, and `round` functions, as you'll probably use
# one or more of these, and you might want to mimic `round`'s arguments.
# If you include additional arguments, put them after x.
dollar <- function(x) {
  # do some stuff to format x
  x
}
