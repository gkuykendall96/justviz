# PERCENTAGE LABELING
# Write a function that takes a number and returns a string formatted as a percentage
# e.g. percentage(0.12) --> "12%"; percentage(0.1) --> "10%"
# Decide whether you want to only round to the nearest whole percentage,
# or allow the user to set the number of decimal points they'd like?
# How would you allow both
#   percentage(0.123, mystery_argument) --> "12%" and
#   percentage(0.123, mystery_argument) --> "12.3%"
# Look at the `format`, `paste`, and `round` functions, as you'll probably use
# one or more of these, and you might want to mimic `round`'s arguments.
# Also look at functions in the `scales` package, which has something similar.
# If you include additional arguments, put them after x.
percentage <- function(x) {
  # do some stuff to format x
  x
}
